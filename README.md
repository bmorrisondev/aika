# Aika ‚è≥ - Time Tracking Made Simple

## Project Overview

Aika is a cross-platform time tracking application built with Expo and React Native. The name "Aika" means "time" in Finnish, reflecting the app's focus on simple, efficient time management. Aika helps users track their work sessions with an intuitive timer interface and comprehensive history of previous time entries.

Key features include:
- Simple start/stop timer functionality
- Task description for each time entry
- History of previous time entries with duration calculation
- User authentication and data persistence
- Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)

## Clerk Authentication Integration

This project showcases how to implement secure, modern authentication in a React Native app using Expo with [Clerk](https://clerk.dev). Clerk provides a complete authentication and user management solution that's easy to implement and highly customizable.

In Aika, Clerk powers:
- User sign-up and sign-in flows
- Session management across devices
- Secure access token handling for backend API calls
- Integration with Supabase for authenticated database access
